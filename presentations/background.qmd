Story idea: I will be doing story idea No. 1 about whether having a good assist-to-turnover ratio actually leads to more wins and analyzing if it is a good measure of team success.

Questions in Canvas assignment

1) Does that data already exist? Can you get it?
2) Do you need assistance in getting it?
3) What time frame do you want/need data from?
4) Will you have to improve or augment the data in order to answer your question? If so, how?
5) Are there other examples of this kind of work (specific or general)? If so, provide them.

Response
1) The data does exist. I can use box score data and game logs from women's college basketball games. I believe I can get this through the sportsdataverse or a wehoops R package which already has the data inside of it.
2) I may need a little assistace getting the data because there will likely be multiple files that are similar but finding the right one for this analysis is essential to the project.
3) I would like to use data from last season 2022-23. I think this would be a good time frame to use because Brenda Frese talked about how having an assist-to-turnover ratio was essential to the team's success. I'm wondering if a text analysis could be a good part of this project to see exactly how many times she said the phrase "assist-to-turnover" ratio last season.
4) I don't believe there will be too much to agument. Unless the dataset does not already have an assist-to-turnover ratio column. If that is not there, I would need to create it by doing a mutate(ATo_ratio = sum(assits) / sum(Turnovers) * 100). Then I would need to calculate a linear model and 
5) Haven't found many articles outlining an analysis in the form of a narrative story but there have been smaller articles.

```{r}
#libraries
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages("wehoop")
library(wehoop)
library(tictoc)
```

Not sure which to use
```{r}
#This is from the textbook

wbb_box_23 <- read_csv("https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/wbblogs23.csv")

```

```{r}

#need to load in box score data and not pbp. 

team_box_2022 <- load_wbb_team_box(seasons = 2022)

```


Data exploration: Creating an assist-to-turnover ratio
```{r}
# This would generate a team and opponent's AstToR for the season
wbb_box_23 %>%
  group_by(TeamFull) %>% 
  summarize(Team_AstToR = sum(TeamAssists) / sum(TeamTurnovers),
            Opp_AstTor = sum(OpponentAssists) / sum (OpponentTurnovers))

#This should give team's AToR in each game
wbb_box_23 %>% 
mutate( Team_AToR = (TeamAssists) / (TeamTurnovers),
        Opp_AToR = (OpponentAssists) / (OpponentTurnovers)) %>% 
filter(TeamFull == "Maryland Terrapins") %>% 
select(Game, Date, TeamFull, Opponent, HomeAway, W_L, TeamScore, OpponentScore, TeamAssists, OpponentAssists, TeamTurnovers, OpponentTurnovers, Team_AToR,   Opp_AToR)

```
Hypothesis: Having an assist-to-turnover ratio over 2 leads to moe wins.
