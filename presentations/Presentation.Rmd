Lede: Fans who listened to Maryland women's basketball head coach Brenda Frese's interviews last season heard the veteran coach say the words assist to turnover ratio. A basketball metric which divides assists by turnovers.

Maryland advanced to the Elite Eight last year on a 1.4 assist to turnover ratio which was eighth best among power 5 teams.
