```{r}
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("cluster")
library(cluster)

set.seed(1234)
```

Notes
- Clusteres are a distance from the mean.
- Trick with clustering is that it ONLY works for numeric columns
- Scale creates a best to worst and we do this in order to calculate the clusteres
Difference between z score and cluster is that we need to make decisios about how many clusteres we want to create. 

This will help you find out who you might want to write about. 

Elbow Method
- Shows the number of clusters it could create
- Want to choose the number of clusters where the line begins to flatten out. 
- Plug in the number into the formula
- 0 means average, positive numbers mean above average and negative numebrs mean below average.


Clustering helps ID what players or teams strengths are and what their peers 
Clusting helps identify WHO you want to compare player X to.
